### **Stay updated**

#### 1. RSS

You can get updates right away using our RSS feed. (I know it seems kinda old-school but it's great)
A good RSS reader in my opinion is newsboat. You can use anything though.
If you're on Linux you can install it using your favorite package manager.

Just add [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spdgmr/posts/main/rss.xml) link to it.

If you need help setting up an RSS reader, please follow [this](https://spdgmr.github.io/rss) guide set up by myself.
