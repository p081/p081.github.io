# Project 081


**Welcome to the temporary Project 081 website.** This is the place where you'll find downloads, documentation, install guides and other useful information.
Project 081 is a modified Mac OS X 10.4.10 Tiger image that allows you to install Tiger on your unsupported Late 2007 and Early 2008 Apple Macs.

**NOTE: This page will eventually be replaced or improved. I apologize for the mess.**

### **Stay updated**
You can get updates right away using our RSS feed. (I know it seems kinda old-school but it's great)
A good RSS reader IMO is newsboat. You can use anything though.
Just add [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spdgmr/posts/main/rss.xml) link to it.

NOTE: The feed also has stuff for other projects.

### **We do not recommend following unofficial install guides as they could potentially be outdated as versions change**
